    "description": "Dr. Miquel Arnedo is Professor of Evolutionary Biology at the Universitat de Barcelona (UB), where he leads the Arthropod Systematics and Evolution Laboratory, and currently serves as Director of the Institut de Recerca de la Biodiversitat (IRBio-UB). His research centres on the evolutionary diversification, systematics, and biogeography of arachnids, with a particular focus on spiders. Throughout his career, Dr. Arnedo has made significant contributions to spider phylogenetics and adaptive radiations, particularly in Mediterranean and island ecosystems. His studies on the red devil spiders (Dysdera) have shed light on speciation, ecological diversification, and evolutionary processes in the Canary Islands. By integrating fieldwork, morphology, and cutting-edge molecular tools, he has published extensively on global spider evolution and the mechanisms shaping diversification in insular and subterranean faunas. More recently, he has expanded his research interests to the application of molecular methods for accelerating biodiversity inventorying and monitoring in hyperdiverse groups such as arthropods, with a growing focus on community ecology. At CISA 2025, Prof. Arnedo will present a plenary lecture on the evolution and diversification of spiders across island archipelagos. Drawing on striking examples of adaptive radiations in different spider lineages, his talk will explore the Macaronesian and other oceanic islands as natural laboratories for understanding the dynamics of adaptive diversification. His talk will showcase both his pioneering contributions to spider systematics and evolution, as well as their broader significance for island biodiversity and conservation.",
