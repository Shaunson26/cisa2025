          Welcome to CISA 2025 (VI Iberian Congress of Biological Systematics),
          which will be held in Tenerife from October 27 to 31, 2025. The
          congress is organized by the Institute of Natural Products and
          Agrobiology (IPNA-CSIC) and will take place at the Museum of Science
          and the Cosmos (MCC), a truly inspiring venue to host this scientific
          event.

          Holding CISA 2025 in Tenerife and the Canary Islands is a unique
          opportunity to combine cutting-edge biodiversity science with the
          archipelago's exceptional biological, geological and historical
          richness. The main objective of the meeting is the presentation and
          exchange of the latest advances in systematics and evolutionary
          biology to understand the taxonomy, phylogenetics, phylogeography,
          biogeography, and adaptation patterns of animals, plants, fungi, and
          unicellular organisms. We aim to stimulate scientific debate and
          networking around the development of these fields, focusing on the
          latest technologies, approaches, biotic frontiers and paradigms.

          This is the sixth edition of CISA, with previous editions held in
          Madrid (2012), Barcelona (2013), Vitoria (2015), Palma de Mallorca
          (2018), and Madrid again (2023). CISA meetings have proven to be
          fantastic opportunities for researchers focused on evolutionary
          biology across the Iberian Peninsula and Macaronesia to discuss,
          exchange, and debate ideas, as well as to establish long-lasting
          collaborations. These congresses are committed to offering an engaging
          program that encourages active participation from young researchers
          and has also been excellent platforms for postdoctoral initiatives.

          The main aim of this symposium is to reconnect the community of
          Iberian and Macaronesian senior researchers, early-career scientists,
          and PhD students dedicated to systematics and evolutionary biology.
          And what better place to do this than in Tenerife, a meeting point
          between continents, offering a rich cultural and natural environment
          to foster science and leisure. We are truly excited to welcome you to
          Tenerife this October!
